## 🧪 DevRelay GitHub Round – Complete

✅ **DevRelay GitHub Round completed successfully**

We turned half-remembered UI instructions into a fully working website —  
and somehow managed **not to break the main branch**.

This repository stands as final proof that:
> **Teamwork + tight deadlines = productivity**

Built under pressure, refined through iteration, and delivered on time.
